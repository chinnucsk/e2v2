.. rubric:: New to Erlang?

e2 helps you write better software faster!

Better software is software that:

* Meets or exceeds user expectations
* Accommodates change
* Presents problems in obvious ways

You write software faster when you:

* Write fewer lines of code
* Write fewer tests
* Spend less time debugging and fixing problems

e2 is `Erlang`_ -- it's not a new language! It doesn't define any new
concepts. It makes Erlang easier to use and highlights important design
concepts that aren't always obvious when approaching Erlang for the first time.

.. rubric:: Already Using Erlang?

If you're using OTP, you're writing too much boilerplate in your
code. Boilerplate adds "noise" to your modules, which makes them needlessly
hard to write and read.

If you're not using OTP, you should be! But you may perceive the cost as being
too high -- sometimes it's easier just to write "low level" Erlang.

e2 helps you write 100% OTP compliant code without the boilerplate and
complexity!

e2 also helps you to understand and use important Erlang/OTP design patterns
that are not obvious when reading Erlang documentation.
